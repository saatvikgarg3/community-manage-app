 TO RUN ON LOCAL SERVER:  Be sure to change the Localhost of Ip you are using to connect the MongoDB Compass and create a Schema called Login or any other(you need to change) in /src/config.js

All the API endpoints are in /src/index.js 

Read the comments for better clarifications of any endpoint of api, also for functionality i implemented all the edge cases and checks necessary which can be changed if wanted by reading the comments for every endpoint in there itself. 

I also have mentioned the areas where more better management can be done in future with full knowledge from frontenthat is how it is working.

I didn't used the cookie but headers authorization method for accessing tokens.

For Testing of apis i used my personal api tester build by me. You can use Postman as i prefer that. Also if you wanna check out my code for personal api tester,go search through my repositories, you will find amazing projects.
